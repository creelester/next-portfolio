# A New Chapter: From Activision to Filmhub

After an incredible journey at Activision building tools and platforms for some of the biggest gaming franchises in the world, I've embarked on a new adventure as a Senior Full Stack Engineer at Filmhub. While the transition from AAA gaming to film distribution technology might seem like a leap, it's been one of the most rewarding decisions of my career.

## The Freedom to Innovate

One of the most exciting aspects of my new role at Filmhub is the level of ownership I have over my code. Coming from a large enterprise environment where processes, legacy systems, and multiple layers of approval were the norm, the ability to experiment, make architectural decisions, and see ideas go from concept to production quickly has been absolutely liberating.

Don't get me wrong—I loved my time at Activision. Working on A/B testing platforms, design systems, and marketing sites for beloved gaming franchises taught me invaluable lessons about scale, performance, and working with cross-functional teams. But there's something special about having the autonomy to shape the technical direction of your work and the freedom to experiment with cutting-edge technologies.

## The Tech Stack I'm Falling in Love With

At Filmhub, I'm working with a modern tech stack that perfectly balances proven reliability with innovative capabilities. Let me tell you what I'm using and why each technology has me so excited.

### Next.js: The Full Stack Framework

Next.js has become my go-to framework, and honestly, it's hard to imagine going back to anything else. The ability to build both frontend and backend in a single, cohesive application is a game-changer. I'm particularly excited about the new React Server Components architecture, which lets me build incredibly fast, SEO-friendly applications while maintaining an excellent developer experience. The file-based routing system makes project structure intuitive and scalable, and I love how everything from image optimization to code splitting just works out of the box. It means I spend less time configuring build tools and more time actually building features that matter.

The edge functions are another game-changer. Being able to run serverless functions at the edge for lightning-fast response times globally means our users get a snappy experience no matter where they are in the world. It's the kind of performance that would have required significant infrastructure work in the past, but now it's just part of the framework.

### React: Still the Best UI Library

React continues to evolve, and React 19 brings some incredible improvements that make me appreciate it even more. The ability to build complex UIs from simple, reusable components never gets old. There's something deeply satisfying about creating a small, focused component and then seeing it work perfectly across different parts of the application.

The ecosystem is another huge win. There's usually a well-maintained solution for any problem I encounter, and the community around React is both massive and incredibly helpful. React DevTools, hot reloading, and the overall developer experience make building interfaces genuinely enjoyable. And now with Server Components, we can mix server and client rendering in ways that open up powerful optimization possibilities I'm still discovering.

### TypeScript: Type Safety That Actually Helps

TypeScript has completely changed how I write JavaScript, and I can't imagine going back. The type errors caught at compile time rather than runtime have saved me countless hours of debugging. There's something incredibly reassuring about refactoring a large chunk of code and having TypeScript tell me exactly what needs to be updated throughout the entire codebase.

The type definitions also serve as inline documentation, making code so much easier to understand and maintain. When I'm working with a function someone else wrote, I don't have to dig through implementation details or hope the documentation is up to date—the types tell me exactly what to expect. The autocomplete and intelligent suggestions in my IDE make me significantly more productive, and when collaborating with teammates, having type definitions creates a contract that makes everything smoother and less error-prone.

### Prisma: Database Access Done Right

Prisma has revolutionized how I work with databases. The auto-generated types based on my database schema mean I get TypeScript safety all the way to the database layer, which feels like magic. No more runtime errors from typos in column names or mismatched types between my code and database.

Database migrations are handled elegantly with a clear version history, and the intuitive API makes even complex queries simple and readable. I particularly love Prisma Studio—the visual database browser is perfect for debugging and exploring data during development. And the performance optimizations with connection pooling and optimized queries mean I don't have to constantly worry about common pitfalls.

## The Joy of Full Ownership

What ties all of this together is the ability to make decisions about the architecture, experiment with new patterns, and see the direct impact of my work. When you have full ownership over your code, you think differently about it. You're not just implementing a feature—you're crafting a solution that you'll maintain and evolve. You care more deeply because it's yours.

This ownership extends beyond just the code. I'm involved in product decisions, architecture planning, and technical strategy. It's the kind of holistic engagement with the product that makes every day exciting and meaningful. I can try something new, see if it works, and iterate quickly without getting stuck in approval loops or fighting against established patterns that don't quite fit.

## Building for Impact

At Filmhub, we're democratizing film distribution, making it easier for independent filmmakers to get their work onto streaming platforms worldwide. There's something deeply satisfying about knowing that the code I write helps creators share their stories with global audiences. It's not just about building features—it's about enabling artists and storytellers to reach people who might never have discovered their work otherwise.

The combination of cutting-edge technology, meaningful work, and the freedom to innovate has made this transition incredibly fulfilling. I'm building features faster, experimenting with new approaches, and learning more than I have in years. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies.

## Looking Forward

I'm only a few months into this journey, but I'm already seeing the impact of working in an environment that values innovation, ownership, and modern technology. The tech stack I'm using at Filmhub—Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Prisma—represents the best of what modern web development has to offer, and I feel fortunate to work with these tools every day.

If you're considering a career move or wondering whether to jump into a new technology stack, my advice is this: find a place where you can own your work, experiment fearlessly, and use tools that make you excited to code every day. That's when the magic happens. That's when you go from just writing code to crafting solutions you're genuinely proud of.
